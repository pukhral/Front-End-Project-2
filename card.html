			<p class="description">Under the common name of Asian Paradise Flycatcher, there are 3 types of male birds. The long-tailed white morph, the long-tailed rufous 
			   colored dark morph and the normal tailed rufous male Flycatcher. The bird is about 21cm long with the tail feathers elongating another 28
			   cm long. The tail feathers consist of 12 feathers among which 2 central feathers are growing into streamers. The Asian Paradise Flycatcher
			   is monogamous and again it is the female who do the choosing. Those female who matured earlier will have the first choice of choosing the
			   more matured male, the white morph and those with no choice but have to be contended with the short tail rufous Paradise Flycatcher. 
			   This assumption came about from observations on the size of the clutches of eggs, each type of male helped in producing.

The male bird handles the nest building task by himself </p>
